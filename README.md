## Brief
## React Architecture

## Java Architecture
### Monolithic
This is the original monolithic architecture: 

![Monolithic architecture diagram](https://github.com/LuKeF-2021/Group3FinalGroupProjectCNE/blob/main/ReadMeFiles/Monolith%20Architecture%20Diagram.png)

This was quick to set up and was built and ready to be used with Postman within a day. We were able to use this as a base for our final microservice based springboot app. 
### Microservices

## Microservices Unit and Integration Test Coverage
We used a Microservice architecture for our final project because of its key Benefits:
- Improved Scalability
- Better Fault Isolation and More Resilient Applications
- Programming Language and Technology Agnostic
- Better Data Security and Compliance
- Faster Time to Market and Future-Proofing
- Greater Business Agility and Support for DevOps
- Support for "Two-Pizza Development Teams.

## Automated Devlopment

- Terraform:- Provisioning Resources
- ansible:- Allocation of Resources

## Manual Development

- sudo visudo to give jenkins sudoers
- aws configure entered im user
- change the ip address in the playbook
- setup credentials in Jenkins credentials manager 
- ssh keygen in jenkins machine so setup vm can access it
